# Premier League Teams
## Author: Kieran Armstrong
## Objective
My goal in this project is to create an interface through which users can add, remove, update and view information about players on Premier League teams. 

## Planning, Tracking and Design
For the purpose of tracking my project, I will be using an application called Trello. Trello allows me to track tasks and progress in a simple and visualised format and in one centralised location. It also contains calender and project timeline features which help with time management and ensuring time constraints are maintained.

 I have used LucidChart to create my entity relationship diagram. This application allowed me to easily create diagrams to help visualise my database structure.

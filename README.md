# Premier League Teams
## Author: Kieran Armstrong
## Objective
My goal in this project is to create an interface through which users can add, remove, update and view information about players on Premier League teams. 

## Planning, Tracking and Design
For the purpose of tracking my project, I will be using an application called Trello. Trello allows me to track tasks and progress in a simple and visualised format and in one centralised location. It also contains calender and project timeline features which help with time management and ensuring time constraints are maintained.

 I have used LucidChart to create my entity relationship diagram. This application allowed me to easily create diagrams to help visualise my database structure.

 ## Risk Assessment
 
 ## Front End 
 I have created a simple user interface that allows users to navigate to different pages.
 Users can create, read, update and delete both players and teams by navigating to the relevant page and using the data entry fields. Changes are enforced using buttons
